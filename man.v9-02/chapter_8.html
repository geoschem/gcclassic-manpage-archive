<p class="size24bi">8. Using Git to manage the GEOS&ndash;Chem source code</p>
<p>In this chapter we list the Git commands that you will most commonly use to 
  manage your local GEOS&ndash;Chem repository. For more information (including 
  information about installing Git on your system), please see:</p>

<p class="size20bi"><a name="RevisionHistory" id="RevisionHistory"></a>8.1 Viewing the revision history</p>
<p align="justify">Use the <strong>gitk</strong> viewer to examine the contents 
  of your Git-backed GEOS&ndash;Chem source code directory. You have two choices:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="justify">Change into the <tt>Code.v9-02</tt> directory and start <strong>gitk</strong> as follows:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <tt>cd Code.v9-02<br>
      gitk --all &   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# This will show ALL open branches</tt>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Or if you are using the <strong>git gui</strong> GUI browser (<a href="#GitGui" title="">more 
    on that below</a>), invoke <strong>gitk</strong> from the <strong>Repository/Visualize 
    All Branch History</strong> menu item. </li>
</ol>
<p align="justify">At the top left of the <strong>gitk</strong> screen, you will see the graph   of revisions.  Each dot represents a commit, along with the log message   that accompanied each commit. Note that the most recent commit (i.e. the line at the very top), there are 2 green boxes at the top, one named <strong>master</strong> and one named <strong>origin</strong>:</p>
  
<ol>
  <li> 
    <p align="justify"><strong>origin:</strong> Therefore, this indicates the 
      "pristine", unchanged code that you got from the download. </p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p align="justify"><strong>master:</strong> This represents the current state 
      of your local repository. Because you haven't done anything to the code 
      yet, the <strong>master</strong> and <strong>origin</strong> branches both 
      point to the same commit. </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p align="justify">If you click on any of the commits in the top left window, in the   window below, you will see the log message and a list of changes to the   source code.  The old code is marked in <strong><span class="red">RED</span></strong> and the new code is marked   in <span class="green"><strong>GREEN</strong></span>.  At right you will also see a list of files that were changed   during the commit.</p>
<p align="justify">So you can easily see how the code has evolved by using <strong>gitk</strong>. 
</p>

<p><img src="../../../img/black_rule.jpg" height="2" width="100%"></p>  
<p class="size20bi"><a name="Revisions" id="Revisions"></a>8.2 Making Revisions</p>

<p class="size18bi"><a name="GitGui" id="GitGui"></a>8.2.1 Using the GUI browser</p>
<p align="justify">Use the <strong>git gui</strong> for source code management. 
  Start this in your <tt>Code.v9-02</tt> directory:</p>
<blockquote>
  <tt>cd Code.v9-02<br>
  git gui & </tt>
</blockquote>
<p>On the left there are 2 windows: </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="justify"><strong>Unstaged Changes:</strong> Git is telling you that 
      it doesn't recognize these changes as belonging to the repository. If you 
      modified any files since the last commit, you will see them displayed here. 
      Right above this window you will find the name of the current checked-out 
      branch. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="justify"><strong>Staged Changes:</strong> Git will add these changes 
      to the repository the next time you make a commit. </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p align="justify">Whenever you need to modify the source code, you should NOT 
  do it on the <strong>master</strong> branch. Create a new branch for your modifications. 
  Test your modifications in the new branch ad nauseum until you are sure that 
  everything is functioning as it should. When you are done <a href="#Merging">merge</a> 
  your new branch back into the <strong>master</strong> branch. You can then <a href="#Deleting" title="">delete</a> 
  the branch you were testing in.</p>
<p align="justify">If you ever need to start over from scratch, you can just go 
  back to the <strong>master</strong> branch and you will get back the state of 
  the code before your modifications were added. This will save you time.</p>

<p class="size18bi"><a name="Branches" id="Branches"></a>8.2.2 Creating branches</p>
<p align="justify">To create a new branch, go to the <strong>Branch/Create</strong> on the menu (or type <strong>CTRL&ndash;N</strong>).  You will get a dialog box that prompts you for the new branch name.  Type a unique name and then click Create. </p>
<p>You should pick names that have meaning to you.  For example, some good branch names are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Bug_fix_sulfate_mod </li>
  <li>CO2_simulation</li>
  <li>KPP_with_isoprene</li>
  <li>Methane_simulation</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be automatically placed into the branch you have just created. </p>

<p class="size18bi"><a name="Committing" id="Committing"></a>8.2.3 Committing</p>
<p align="justify">With Git, you should commit frequently, such as when you have   completed making revisions to a file or group of files.  Commits that   are made on one branch will not affect the other branches. </p>
<p align="justify">Committing is best done with the <strong>git gui</strong>. 
  Follow these steps: </p>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <p align="justify">Pick <strong>Commit/Rescan</strong> from the menu (or type 
      the <strong>F5</strong> key). This forces the <strong>git gui</strong> to show the latest 
      changes.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p align="justify">You should see a list of files in the <strong>Unstaged 
      Changes</strong> window. Clicking on the icon at the left of a file will 
      send it to the <strong>Staged Changes</strong> window. Git will add all 
      of the files in <strong>Staged Changes</strong> to the repository the next 
      time you commit. Note: Clicking on the icon of the files in the <strong>Staged 
      Changes</strong> moves back the file to the <strong>Unstaged Changes</strong> 
      window. </p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p align="justify">Type a <strong>Commit message</strong> in the bottom right 
      window. <a href="http://spheredev.org/wiki/Git_for_the_lazy#Writing_good_commit_messages" title="http://spheredev.org/wiki/Git_for_the_lazy#Writing_good_commit_messages" target="_new" rel="nofollow">See 
      this example of a good commit message</a>. Some pointers are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> The first line should only be 50 characters or less and succinctly 
        describe the commit </li>
      <li> Then leave a blank line </li>
      <li> Then add more in-depth text that describes the commit </li>
      <li> Then click on the <strong>Signed-off by</strong> button. This will 
        add your name, email address, and a timestamp. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="justify">You will see two radio buttons above the <strong>Commit 
      message</strong> window. Specify the type of commit:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>New commit: Assumes we are making a totally new commit (default setting).</li>
      <li>Amend last commit: If for whatever reason we need to update the last 
        commit message, pick this button.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p align="justify">Click on the <strong>Commit</strong> button.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Then if you <a href="#RevisionHistory" title="">start the <strong>gitk</strong> viewer</a>, your new commit should be visible.</p>

<p class="size18bi"><a name="Checkout" id="Checkout"></a>8.2.4 Switching between branches</p>
<p align="justify">Before you switch from one branch to another (aka "checking 
  out a branch"), <a href="#Committing" title="">commit any remaining unstaged files</a> 
  to the current open branch. Unstaged files will remain in your working directory 
  even after you checkout a different branch. This can will lead to confusion.</p>
<p align="justify">To check out a new branch, go to <strong>Branch/Checkout</strong> 
  on the menu and pick the name of the branch you would like to switch to. The 
  current branch name will be displayed just below the menu at top left. </p>
<p align="justify">Once you have created your branch and have checked it out, 
  you can start modifying it with your favorite text editor. (We recommend Emacs.)</p>
<p align="justify">We recommend to keep one open branch per new feature that you 
  are adding into GEOS&ndash;Chem. This lets you test each individual feature 
  separately. After you have validated each feature, you can <a href="#Merging">merge</a> 
  its branch back into the master.</p>


<p class="size18bi"><a name="Merging" id="Merging"></a>8.2.5 Merging</p>
<p align="justify">Follow this procedure to merge your changes back into the <strong>master</strong> 
  branch:</p>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <p align="justify">Switch back to the <strong>master</strong> branch by selecting 
      <strong>Branch/Checkout</strong> from the menu (or type <strong>CTRL&ndash;O</strong>). 
      You will be given a dialog box of available branches. Select <strong>master</strong> 
      and click Checkout.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p align="justify"> Pick <strong>Merge/Local Merge</strong> from the menu 
      (or type <strong>CTRL&ndash;M</strong>). You will be given a dialog box 
      of available branches. Select the branch you would like to merge into <strong>master</strong> 
      and click Merge.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p align="justify">This should merge your changes back into <strong>master</strong>. 
  Then if you <a href="#RevisionHistory" title="">start the <strong>gitk</strong> viewer</a>, 
  the you should see your changes in the master branch.</p>


<p class="size18bi"><a name="Tagging" id="Tagging"></a>8.2.6 Tagging</p>
<p align="justify">Git lets you tag a particular commit with an alphanumeric string 
  for easy reference. This tag will allow users to just refer to the tag name 
  using <a href="#GitPull"><tt>git pull</tt></a>. </p>
<p align="justify">Tagging can be done in one of two ways.  You can add a tag via the command line: </p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>git tag GEOS-Chem v9-02a
git tag GEOS-Chem v9-02b</pre>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">etc. at the Unix command line.</p>
<p align="justify">You may also add a tag via the <strong>gitk</strong> viewer utility, as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="justify">Open the <b>gitk</b> browser:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Type <tt>gitk</tt> (to view the current branch), or </li>
      <li> Type <tt>gitk --all</tt> to view all branches. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="justify">In the top-left window select a commit by clicking on it with the mouse</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="justify">Right-click to pull up the context menu.  Select the <strong>Create tag</strong> option.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="justify">Type in your tag text and click Create.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>To remove a tag, you can use the <tt>git tag</tt> command directly:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>git tag -d TAG_NAME</pre></blockquote>

<p>Where <tt>TAG_NAME</tt> is the name of the tag that you have added.</p>
<p>NOTE: Tagging is something that typically only the <a href="http://wiki.seas.harvard.edu/geos-chem/index.php/GEOS-Chem_Support_Team" target="_new">GEOS&ndash;Chem Support Team</a> will do.</p>

<p class="size18bi"><a name="Deleting" id="Deleting"></a>8.2.7 Deleting branches</p>
<p align="justify">Once you have merged your changes back into the <strong>master</strong> 
  branch, you can delete the branch you just created. In the <strong>git gui</strong>, 
  go to the <strong>Branch/Delete</strong> menu item. Select the name of the branch 
  that you wish to delete from the dialog box display.</p>

<p><img src="../../../img/black_rule.jpg" height="2" width="100%"></p>  
<p class="size20bi"><a name="Sharing" id="Sharing"></a>8.3 Sharing your revisions with others (and vice-versa)</p>

<p align="justify">One of the really nice features of Git is that it can create 
  <strong>patch files</strong>, or files which contain a list of changes that 
  can be imported into someone else's local Git repository. Using patch files 
  obviates the need of having to merge differences between codes manually. </p>

<p class="size18bi"><a name="Patch" id="Patch"></a>8.3.1 Creating a patch file to share with others</p>
<p align="justify">To create a patch file containing the code differences between a branch of your code with your <strong>master</strong> branch, type: </p>
<blockquote>
<pre>git format-patch master..BRANCH_NAME --stdout &gt; my-patch-file.diff</pre></blockquote>
<p align="justify">where <tt>BRANCH_NAME</tt> is the name of the branch that you want to compare against the <strong>master</strong> branch. </p>
<p align="justify">You can also create a patch file for a given number of past commits by typing: </p>
<blockquote><pre>git format-patch -3 --stdout &gt; my-patch-file.diff</pre></blockquote>
<p align="justify">If you want the most recent commit then use -1 instead, etc. </p>
<p align="justify">These commands will pipe the output from the <tt>git format-patch</tt> command to a file named by you (in this case <tt>my-patch-file.diff</tt>,   but you may select whatever name you wish).  You can then include the   patch file as an email attachment and send it to other GEOS&ndash;Chem users or the <a href="http://wiki.seas.harvard.edu/geos-chem/index.php/GEOS-Chem_Support_Team" target="_new">GEOS&ndash;Chem Support Team</a>. </p>

<p class="size18bi"><a name="Validate" id="Validate"></a>8.3.2 Checking the validity of a patch file</p>
<p>Other users can send you their source code revisions as patch files. If you 
  want to check the status of a Git patch file (i.e. what it will actually do) 
  before you apply it to your repository, use the git apply command:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>git apply --stat my-patch-file.diff
     
GeosCore/aerosol_mod.F |    7 ++++---   
1 files changed, 4 insertions(+), 3 deletions(-)</pre></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The sample output listed above indicates that the patch contained 4 insertions and 3 deletions from only one file (<tt>aerosol_mod.F</tt>).</p>
<p align="justify">Note that the <tt>git apply --stat</tt> command does not apply the patch, but only shows you the stats about what it will do.  For more   detailed information about the patch, you can open it in either an emacs   or vi window and examine it manually.</p>
<p align="justify">You can also use <tt>git apply</tt> command to determine if 
  the patch will install properly or not. Type:</p>
<blockquote><pre>git apply --check my-patch-file.diff</pre></blockquote>
<p align="justify">If an error occurs, it usually means that the patch was made 
  from an earlier version of GEOS&ndash;Chem. You can rectify this by having the 
  sender recreate the patch with the most recent GEOS&ndash;Chem version.</p>

<p class="size18bi"><a name="Ingest" id="Ingest"></a>8.3.3 Reading a patch file into your local repository</p>
<p align="justify">To ingest a patch file into your local Git repository, first 
  <a href="#Branches" title="">make a new branch</a>. Then follow this procedure: 
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="justify">Pick <strong>Branch/Create</strong> from the menu (or type <strong>CTRL&ndash;N</strong>).  Give your branch a descriptive name like "Updates_from_xxxx" that will serve as a mnemonic.</p></li>
  <li><p align="justify">Pick <strong>Branch/Checkout</strong> from the menu (or type <strong>CTRL&ndash;O</strong>) and switch to the branch you just created.</p></li>
  <li><p align="justify">To ingest the other person's source code changes, type:</p>
  <blockquote><pre>git am &lt; their-patch-file.diff</pre></blockquote></li>
</ol>
<p align="justify">You can then test the other person's revisions in the separate branch until you are sure they are OK.  Then you can <a href="#Merging" title="">merge them back into the <strong>master</strong> branch</a> as described above.</p>

<p class="size18bi"><a name="MorePatch" id="MorePatch"></a>8.3.4 More about patch files</p>
<p align="justify">For more information about Git patch files, please see the 
  following links:</p>

<p><img src="../../../img/black_rule.jpg" height="2" width="100%"></p>  
<p class="size20bi"><a name="GitPull" id="GitPull"></a>8.4 Getting updates from the remote repository</p>
<p align="justify">We recommend that you use the the <tt>git clone</tt> command 
  to <a href="chapter_2.html#DownCode">download each newly-released GEOS&ndash;Chem 
  version into a new local directory</a>. </p>
<p align="justify">There may be times, however, when "patches" (i.e. minor fixes) 
  need to be applied to an existing GEOS&ndash;Chem version. The easiest way to 
  obtain patches is to use the <tt>git pull</tt> command, as follows: </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p> Change to your local code directory (e.g. <tt>Code.v9-02</tt>) </p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><a href="#Branches">Make a new branch</a> named <strong>patch</strong> (or something similar). </p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><a href="#Checkout">Check out</a> the <strong>patch</strong> branch.  Now we are ready to obtain the updates from the remote server. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Use the <tt>git pull</tt> command to download the updated files, as follows:
    </p>
    <blockquote><pre>git pull git://git.as.harvard.edu/bmy/GEOS-Chem master</pre></blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Test compilation to make sure everything is fine.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><a href="#Checkout" title="">Check out</a> the <strong>master</strong> branch. </p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><a href="#Merging" title="">Merge</a> the <strong>patch</strong> branch into your <strong>master</strong> branch. </p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p><a href="#Deleting" title="">Delete</a> the <strong>patch</strong> branch. </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p align="justify">This will merge the changes from the <strong>master</strong> branch of the remote repository into your <strong>master</strong> branch.</p>

<p><img src="../../../img/black_rule.jpg" height="2" width="100%"></p>  
<p class="size20bi"><a name="Revert" id="Revert"></a>8.5 Reverting to an older state of the code</p>
<p align="justify">When you clone GEOS&ndash;Chem from the remote repository to your local disk space (with the <tt>git clone</tt> command), the repository will point to the most recent commit.    However, you may want to revert to an older state of the code.  Git   allows you to do this very easily. </p>
<p align="justify">Let's assume that the latest version of the code is v9&ndash;02, but   that you want to use the version v8&ndash;03&ndash;01.  The procedure is   as follows: </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="justify">Clone GEOS&ndash;Chem with:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>git clone git://git.as.harvard.edu/bmy/GEOS-Chem Code.v9-02</pre></blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="justify">Open the <strong>gitk</strong> browser by typing <tt>gitk --all &amp;</tt> at the command line.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="justify">In the top-left window of <strong>gitk</strong>, find the commit that you want   to revert to.  Usually this will be denoted with a yellow tag (e.g. <strong>v8&ndash;03&ndash;01</strong> or <strong>v8&ndash;03&ndash;01&ndash;benchmark</strong>).  However, if there are any post-release patches, be sure you select the oldest one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="justify">Right click with the mouse.  This will open a context menu.  Select <strong>Create new branch</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="justify">A new dialog box will pop up asking you to name the branch.  Type <strong>Code.v8&ndash;03&ndash;01</strong> and click Create.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="justify">Close <strong>gitk</strong> and open the <strong>git gui</strong> by typing <tt>git gui &amp;</tt>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p align="justify">From the <strong>git gui</strong> dropdown menu, select <strong>Branch / Checkout</strong>, and then pick <strong>Code.v8&ndash;03&ndash;01</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p align="justify">That's it!  We now have two branches that represent different GEOS&ndash;Chem versions. </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="justify">The <strong>master</strong> branch represents the state of the code as of the v9&ndash;02 release.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> The <strong>Code.v8&ndash;03&ndash;01</strong> branch represents the state of the code as of the v8&ndash;03&ndash;01 release. </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p align="justify">You can work on the <strong>Code.v8&ndash;03&ndash;01</strong> 
  branch as you wish. You can create further branches off of the <strong>Code.v8&ndash;03&ndash;01</strong> 
  branch. You can always revert to the v9&ndash;02 state of the code 
  by just switching back to the <strong>master</strong> branch (with <strong>Branch 
  / Checkout</strong> from the <strong>git gui</strong> dropdown menu).</p>
